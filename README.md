## Tools used

On host

 - DosBox-x
 - FreeDOS
 - Visual Studio Code
 
 For DOS development
 
  - Open Watcom C/C++ Version 1.9
  
  OW was used because it was easy to obtain via FreeDos package manager. Turns out that Abrash book was written for/tested on Borland C++/Turbo C++ and some massaging would be needed here and there.
